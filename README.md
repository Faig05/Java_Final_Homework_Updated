# Final Java Project (Java Labs)

## ✍️ Description

This is my final project for Java Labs. 
The application is a Spring Boot web project that accepts parameters directly from the URL and displays them dynamically on the frontend. It also includes a simple HTML page using Thymeleaf, and a sample image is displayed to show that the frontend is functional.


The main goal was to:
- Create a Spring Boot application.
- Handle dynamic input from the URL.
- Display it on a working frontend using Thymeleaf.
- Add an image to confirm the frontend is active.
- Create an opportunity to write anything you want (with 4 parts) to the URL itself, in one word, make a **CustomURL**
- Upload the entire project to GitHub with README file.

## 🚀 How It Works

Once the application is running, you can open your browser and visit a URL like this:

http://localhost:8080/FaigAliyev68741/Group3/FinalJavaProject/Welcome-To-My-Final-Page/


Where:
- `FaigAliyev68741` is treated as the username,
- `Group3` as the group number,
- `FinalJavaProject` as the project name,
- `Welcome-To-My-Final-Page` is the welcome message **(with dashes automatically converted to spaces in the view)**.

The app will read these parts from the URL, process them, and display a complete message on the HTML page.

## 📸 Image on Frontend

To confirm that the frontend is active, I added an image located in the `static/images/` folder, and it’s being shown properly on the webpage.
